### Acknowledgements

I received inspiration for this project from Code institute, Myself and my Wife.

I started this project from the codeinstitute Resume Project "Rosie Odenkirk" code and template (as mentioned in the tutorial), 
I adjusted code, design and added my code as I needed for my project look, feel and function.
I added the bootstrap modal in the products pages (get a quote - button) using the code learned in the "Whiskey Drop" codeinstitute 
tutorial with some modifications by myself.

I used the carousel code from bootstrap and made some adjustment to reflect my intentions.

I used text effext code (class .strokeme from stackoverflow.com).

I used text effext code (class p::first-letter from w3schools.com).

I used Zoom Hover effect from (https://codepen.io/preecb/pen/mdJJdLy).



#### Notes

I started this project in a different repositoy https://github.com/hameederrawi/UCFD-M-Project1 
but encountered a problem with git commands as I was trying to remove some unwanted files (as adviced by mentor) via 
the .git rm command, I was then encountering the "diverged" error .
I encountered the error above few days before project submission dead line.
I did not have much time to risk in research for a solution, as unfortunatly Github was displaying the message "github peges error, maybe a connection problem".
So I started this new repository and copied all needed files to it.
Hence the previous repository will have more record of commits than this one.

The unwanted files that were created with the repository automatically have now been removed (using the same commands that I caused the error above, 
There was no issue this time!) I reached out to Code institute support prior to attempting the removal, they confirmed the commands to use.
